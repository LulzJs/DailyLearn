# The First Day


## Gitbook

So i have started writing using GitBook, to take notes of what i learn every day. a few things have shown up.

1. There are some required files if you start from a GitHub repository that you will have to create:
    * README.md
    * SUMMARY.md


2. Markdown is partially working as per escape characters don't work with &#35; and numbering and listing get confused easyli.

## C&#35;

When doing complex objects a builder pattern is always welcome. To remove some complexity of just adding steps in your constructor to something more abstract and can contain the logic.
