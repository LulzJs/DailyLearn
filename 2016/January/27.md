##**Meteor**

###**Documentation**

I found a lot of interesting things in this link, i can setup my view model to a real JavaScript object.

###**Markdown**

To add markdown support you will have to add the markdown package:

```
meteor add markdown
```

If you also want your snippets of code to have some style you will also need to add the highlight.js package:

```
meteor add simple:highlight.js
```

###**AutoForm**

to get a multi-line input you need to make sure you get a textarea. This can be done in the collection definition by:
```js
TestSchema = new SimpleSchema({
    content: {
        type: String,
        label: "Content",
        autoform: {
            rows: 10
        }
    }
});
```
##**C# - Fluent Interfaces**

I have not experiment to much with fluent interfaces. But is something cool especially to make code that is expressive. Is really do this kind of work with generics.

```csharp
public myClass
{
}
