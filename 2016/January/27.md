##**Meteor**

###**Documentation**

I found a lot of interesting things in this link, i can setup my view model to a real JavaScript object.

###**Markdown**

To add markdown support you will have to add the markdown package:

```
meteor add markdown
```

If you also want your snippets of code to have some style you will also need to add the highlight.js package:

```
meteor add simple:highlight.js
```

###**AutoForm**

to get a multi-line input you need to make sure you get a textarea. This can be done in the collection definition by:
```js
TestSchema = new SimpleSchema({
    content: {
        type: String,
        label: "Content",
        autoform: {
            rows: 10
        }
    }
});
```
##**C# - Fluent Interfaces with Extension Methods**

I have not experiment to much with fluent interfaces. But is something cool especially to make code that is expressive.

```csharp
public class Complex
{
    double x;
    double y;
    double z;
    
    public Complex()
    {
        x = 1.456;
        y = 1.234;
        z = 1.789;
    }
}
```
also can be used with some language properties to make it more expressive
```csharp
public static class GeneralExtensions
{
    public static T As<T>(this object o) where T : class
    {
        return o as T;
    }

    public static T Cast<T>(this object o)
    {
        return (T)o;
    }

    public static bool Is<T>(this object o)
    {
        return o is T;
    }
}
 
```
