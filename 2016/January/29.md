###**GIT**

Removing branches will not remove commits, to have them referenced to be used in the future you just need to tag them.

###**C# - Paths to system folders**

In the Environment class there is a property called SpecialFolder. This will provide the paths to folders like: Program files, desktop, AppData, etc. The use is the next one:

```csharp
Environment.SpecialFolder.<NameSpecialFolder>
```

Where ```<NameSpecialFolder>``` is the given name of the folder required, for example the AppData Local folder will be 

```csharp
Environment.SpecialFolder.LocalApplicationData
```
