##**C# - Extension Method overlap with LINQ**

the intention was to be able to call my code in something like this


    MyObject.CastTo<MyInterface>();I think I have hit a corner case of extension methods and LINQ.

Today I was declaring some extension methods to make my code more readable.So I created an extension method that gets an object and performs a direct cast:

 <!-- language: c# -->

    public static class GeneralExtensions
    {
        public static T Cast<T>(this object o)
        {
        	return (T)o;
        }
    }

The intention was to be able to call my direct castings by something like this:
 <!-- language: c# -->

    MyObject.CastTo<MyInterface>();

It happens that in the same namespace I have an extension method that has a LINQ expression

<!-- language: c# -->
    
    using System;
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    using System.Linq;
    
    public static class EnumExtenstions
    {
    	public static IEnumerable<string> UseLinq(this IEnumerable<object> collection)
    	{
    		return (from object value in collection select value.ToString() ).ToList();
    	}
    }

Adding this first extension method to my code base cause the next error

    Error	CS1936	Could not find an implementation of the query pattern for source type 'object'.  'Select' not found.	

Having both extension methods in different namespaces (and not referred), or rename <code>Cast<T></code> to something different solves the issue.

I would like to understand a bit more why this is happening. Is it some overlap with LINQ? And if so why my <code>Cast<T></code> has priority?
