##**C# - Extension Method overlap with LINQ**

I think I have hit a corner case of extension methods and LINQ. 

Today I was declaring some extension methods to make my code more readable.So I created an extension method that gets an object and performs a direct cast:

```csharp
public static class GeneralExtensions
{
    public static T Cast<T>(this object o)
    {
    	return (T)o;
    }
}
```

The intention was to be able to call my direct castings by something like this:
```csharp 
MyObject.CastTo<MyInterface>();
```

It happens that in the same namespace I have an extension method that has a LINQ expression
```csharp 
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;

public static class EnumExtenstions
{
	public static IEnumerable<string> UseLinq(this IEnumerable<object> collection)
	{
		return (from object value in collection select value.ToString() ).ToList();
	}
}
```

Adding this first extension method to my code base cause the next error
```
Error	CS1936	Could not find an implementation of the query pattern for source type 'object'.  'Select' not found.	
```

Having both extension methods in different namespaces (and not referred), or rename ```Cast<T>``` to something different solves the issue.
